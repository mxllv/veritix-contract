# Veritix Pay Contract
The core Soroban smart contract for the Veritix Pay ticketing platform, handling token primitives, escrow, splitting, and recurring payments.

## Architecture Overview



The contract is designed with a layered architecture to separate concerns and ensure secure token operations. At the foundational level, `storage_types.rs` acts as the shared foundation, defining the core data keys and structures used across all files. Building upon this, `admin.rs`, `metadata.rs`, `balance.rs`, and `allowance.rs` serve as the token primitives, handling raw ledger updates and basic authorization. The `contract.rs` module acts as the public interface that ties these primitives together, exposing the standard Soroban token functions to the outside world. Finally, complex business logic is encapsulated in payment feature modules like `escrow.rs`, `recurring.rs`, `splitter.rs`, and `dispute.rs`, which sit on top of the primitives to execute real-world ticketing workflows.

Escrow uses the contract address itself as the temporary holder of escrowed funds. `create_escrow` transfers the requested amount from the depositor into `e.current_contract_address()`, so the contract can hold a real token balance while the escrow is pending. `release_escrow` and `refund_escrow` then move that same balance back out to the beneficiary or depositor without minting or burning new tokens.

## Storage Model



| DataKey Variant | Storage Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Admin` | Instance | Stores the `Address` of the contract administrator. |
| `Metadata` | Instance | Stores token details (name, symbol, decimals). |
| `Balance(Address)` | Persistent | Stores the `i128` token balance of an address. |
| `Allowance(AllowanceDataKey)` | Persistent | Stores the `i128` approved spend limit between two addresses. |
| `EscrowCount` | Instance | Tracks the total number of standard escrows created. |
| `Escrow(u32)` | Persistent | Stores an `EscrowRecord` containing lockup details and status. |
| `MultiEscrowCount` | Instance | Tracks the total number of multi-recipient escrows. |
| `MultiEscrow(u32)` | Persistent | Stores a `MultiEscrowRecord` for proportional payouts. |
| `RecurringCount` | Instance | Tracks the total number of recurring payment setups. |
| `Recurring(u32)` | Persistent | Stores a `RecurringRecord` for subscription states. |
| `SplitCount` | Instance | Tracks the total number of payment splits. |
| `Split(u32)` | Persistent | Stores a `SplitRecord` with basis points for each recipient. |
| `DisputeCount` | Instance | Tracks the total number of opened disputes. |
| `Dispute(u32)` | Persistent | Stores a `DisputeRecord` containing adjudication status. |
| `Freeze(Address)` | Persistent | Stores a `bool` indicating if an account is blocked. |

## How to Build and Test
Use the standard makefile commands to interact with the contract:
* `make build`: Compiles the Rust code into a WebAssembly (`.wasm`) binary optimized for the Soroban environment.
* `make test`: Runs the entire comprehensive unit testing suite across all modules to ensure logic and panic states execute correctly.
* `make build-logs`: Produces a local debug-oriented WASM build using the `release-with-logs` Cargo profile. Use this when you want debug assertions enabled while inspecting local contract behavior. This path builds with `cargo` directly rather than `stellar contract build`.
* `make test-logs`: Runs the test suite with the `release-with-logs` profile to mirror the debug-oriented build configuration during local investigation.
* `make clean`: Removes the `target/` directory and compiled binaries.

Snapshot policy: committed files under `contract/token/test_snapshots/` should correspond only to active, non-ignored tests. When adding or changing an active test that emits a snapshot artifact, update the matching snapshot file in the same change and remove snapshot files for ignored or deleted tests.

## Authorization Model
Security is enforced natively using the Soroban SDK. Every state-changing function requires the caller to authorize the transaction, invoked via `address.require_auth()`. Administrative functions rely on `check_admin(&e)`, which verifies the caller against the stored `DataKey::Admin` address. Allowances remain valid when `expiration_ledger == current ledger sequence` and expire only once the ledger advances past that boundary. To prevent state archiving, storage TTL (Time To Live) is bumped automatically during `read_balance` and `read_allowance` calls, ensuring active accounts remain on the ledger.

## Adding a New Module
1. Define any new data structures or `DataKey` variants in `storage_types.rs`.
2. Create your logic file (e.g., `new_feature.rs`) and implement the core functions.
3. Expose the necessary interface methods in `contract.rs`.
4. Register the module by adding `pub mod new_feature;` to `lib.rs`.
5. Create a corresponding `new_feature_test.rs` file to ensure 100% test coverage.
